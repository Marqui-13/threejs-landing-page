## Usage

This projectcan serve as a foundation for web developers looking to incorporate 3D elements into their websites. Whether you're creating an interactive landing page, a portfolio, or a full-fledged web application, the implementation demonstrated in this project can be adapted and expanded upon.

To interact with the 3D scene:
- Explore the 3D Space: Use your mouse or touch (on touch-enabled devices) to interact with the star field. The scene will react to your cursor's position, creating a dynamic, engaging user experience.
- Customize the Appearance: Modify the `main.js` file to experiment with different geometries, materials, and animations. Three.js offers a wide range of APIs to create complex 3D graphics.
- Adjust the Camera: The camera settings can be tweaked to change the perspective from which the scene is viewed, offering different visual experiences.
